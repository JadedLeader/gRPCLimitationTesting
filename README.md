Project Title: 
gRPC stress testing tool 

Project Description: 
This tool is used for testing gRPC high workloads in conjunction with network constrained environments to calculate the delay between when the client sends the request, and when the server responsds to that request. This is done by using both unary and streaming requests and response types, alongside delving into multiple clients on a single channel, single clients on a single channel and other combinations.
